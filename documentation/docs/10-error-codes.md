# Error Codes

Every error from the SDK is an instance of `IframeBridgeError` — a typed error class that carries a machine-readable `code`, a human-readable `message`, and optional `details`. This page catalogs all 27 error codes, explains what triggers each one, and what you should do about it.

The same error class and codes are used by the parent SDK and the child iframe SDK where the failure category applies. Child-specific notes below call out `iframe-helper-sdk/child` behavior without adding separate child-only codes.

If you're stuck on a specific problem, start with the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) page for diagnostic flowcharts. For the config options that trigger validation errors, see [Configuration](./configuration).

---

## IframeBridgeError

```ts
import { IframeBridgeError } from 'iframe-helper-sdk';

class IframeBridgeError extends Error {
  readonly code: IframeBridgeErrorCode;
  readonly details?: unknown;
}
```

- **`name`** is always `'IframeBridgeError'` — you can `instanceof`-check it.
- **`code`** is a string from the `IframeBridgeErrorCode` union. Use it to programmatically branch your error handling.
- **`message`** is a human-readable description of what went wrong.
- **`details`** may carry extra context — for remote errors it includes the normalized `remoteError` object from the iframe, for config errors it may include the invalid value.

:::note Sync vs. async errors

Config validation errors are thrown **synchronously** by `createIframeBridge()` and `createIframeChildBridge()`. They happen before the parent iframe is created or before the child bridge starts, so wrapping the factory call in `try/catch` is sufficient.

Operation errors (timeouts, aborts, remote errors) and lifecycle errors (not ready, destroyed, handshake failed) are delivered as **rejected promises** from methods such as `request()`, `sendEvent()`, `waitForEvent()`, `whenReady()`, and child `whenConnected()`.

## Config Errors

Config errors are thrown synchronously by `createIframeBridge()`, `createTypedIframeBridge()`, and `createIframeChildBridge()` when the provided configuration is invalid or unsafe. You won't have a bridge instance yet — fix the config and try again.

| `CONFIG_INVALID_CONTAINER`         | `container` is missing, not an `Element`, is an invalid selector string, or the selector returned no match.                                                                                                                       | Pass a valid DOM element or a selector that resolves to an element in the document.                                                                                                                             |
| `CONFIG_INVALID_SRC`               | `src` is missing, cannot be parsed as an absolute URL, contains embedded credentials, or uses an unsupported scheme (`javascript:`, `data:`, `blob:`).                                                                            | Use an absolute HTTPS URL without credentials. For localhost HTTP during development, enable `allowInsecureLocalhost`.                                                                                          |
| `CONFIG_INVALID_QUEUE`             | `queue.maxSize` is not a positive integer.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Set `queue.maxSize` to an integer &ge; 1, or omit it to use the default of 50.                                                                                                                                  |
| `CONFIG_INVALID_RESIZE`            | `resizePlugin()` axis is invalid, a resize bound or offset is invalid, `onResize` is not a function, a minimum bound is greater than its matching maximum, or strict mode is missing max bounds for active resize axes.           | Use a valid axis, finite integer offsets, non-negative integer bounds, minimum values that do not exceed maximum values, and max bounds for every active axis in strict mode.                                   |
| `CONFIG_INVALID_SECURITY_PROFILE`  | `securityProfile` is set to a value other than `'development'` or `'strict'`.                                                                                                                                                     | Use `'strict'` for production fail-fast behavior, `'development'` for warnings, or omit the option entirely.                                                                                                    |
| `CONFIG_INVALID_TIMEOUT`           | `bootstrap.handshakeTimeoutMs`, child `bootstrap.connectionTimeoutMs`, or `timeouts.operationTimeoutMs` is not a positive integer.                                                                                                | Set timeout values to integers &ge; 1, or omit them to use the defaults.                                                                                                                                        |
| `CONFIG_UNSAFE_ORIGIN`             | A configured origin (`src`, `targetOrigin`, `allowedOrigin`, `bootstrap.parentOrigin.value`, or child `allowedParentOrigins`) is empty, wildcard-based, non-HTTPS (outside localhost development), or contains a path/query/hash. | Use exact HTTPS origins. For localhost HTTP during development, set `allowInsecureLocalhost: true` on the parent side. Child `allowedParentOrigins` must be omitted, `null`, or a non-empty exact-origin array. |
| `CONFIG_UNSAFE_PERMISSIONS_POLICY` | `iframeAttributes.allow` uses a wildcard (`*`) grant in `securityProfile: 'strict'`.                                                                                                                                              | Replace `*` with an explicit feature list scoped to the features your iframe actually needs (e.g., `"fullscreen 'self'"`).                                                                                      |
| `CONFIG_UNSAFE_SANDBOX`            | `sandbox` combines `allow-scripts` with `allow-same-origin` in `securityProfile: 'strict'`. This combination effectively removes sandbox isolation.                                                                               | Remove one of the conflicting tokens, or switch to `securityProfile: 'development'` after a documented security review.                                                                                         |
| `DIAGNOSTICS_INVALID_MAX_ENTRIES`  | `maxEntries` passed to `createDiagnosticRecorder()` is not a positive integer.                                                                                                                                                    | Pass an integer &ge; 1, or omit the option to use the default of 100.                                                                                                                                           |

:::warning Config errors are synchronous

These errors are thrown during config normalization, **before** any iframe is created or mounted. Your `createIframeBridge()` or `createIframeChildBridge()` call itself is the throwing boundary — wrap it in `try/catch`.

## Handshake Errors

Handshake errors occur during the bridge readiness phase — between iframe mount and the first valid `bridge:ready` message. For the full handshake sequence and protocol rules, see [Wire Protocol](./wire-protocol#handshake-sequence).

For child SDK integrations, the same mismatch categories apply while the child waits for `bridge:connected` from the accepted parent origin. The session id is still correlation metadata only, not auth or proof of trust.

| Code                          | Typical cause                                                                                                                                               | Recovery                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`           | The iframe did not send a valid `bridge:ready` within `bootstrap.handshakeTimeoutMs` (default: 10 seconds).                                                 | Confirm the iframe reads the configured session and parent origin params, sends `bridge:ready` to the exact parent origin, and the iframe is loaded from the expected origin. Check that the iframe URL resolves and returns HTML. |
| `HANDSHAKE_ORIGIN_MISMATCH`   | An incoming message that looked like a handshake came from an unexpected origin. The SDK rejects it rather than processing a potentially deceptive message. | Verify `allowedOrigin` matches the iframe's actual origin. If the iframe redirects to a different origin, set `allowedOrigin` and `targetOrigin` explicitly.                                                                       |
| `HANDSHAKE_SOURCE_MISMATCH`   | An incoming message that looked like a handshake came from a window other than the owned iframe.                                                            | This usually indicates another window or iframe on the page is sending messages. Verify only one iframe is configured per bridge instance.                                                                                         |
| `HANDSHAKE_SESSION_MISMATCH`  | An incoming message that looked like a handshake carried a `sessionId` that doesn't match this bridge instance.                                             | Check that the iframe echoes the same session parameter the SDK appended to the URL. If you renamed `bootstrap.session.paramName`, make sure the iframe reads the new parameter name.                                              |
| `HANDSHAKE_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH` | An incoming message that looked like a handshake did not declare `protocol: 'iframe-bridge'`.                                                               | The iframe must include `protocol: 'iframe-bridge'` in every envelope. This is part of the wire protocol contract.                                                                                                                 |
| `HANDSHAKE_VERSION_MISMATCH`  | An incoming message that looked like a handshake declared a protocol `version` other than `1`.                                                              | The iframe must set `version: 1`. Future SDK versions may support version negotiation, but MVP requires exact match.                                                                                                               |

Child context: `HANDSHAKE_ORIGIN_MISMATCH` can indicate that `bridge:connected` came from an origin other than the accepted parent origin. A bootstrap parent origin that is not in configured `allowedParentOrigins` is a config-time `CONFIG_UNSAFE_ORIGIN` failure. If `allowedParentOrigins` is omitted or `null`, the child accepts the bootstrap parent origin and relies on iframe-side controls such as CSP `frame-ancestors` to restrict embedding.

:::info Handshake mismatch errors and diagnostics

`HANDSHAKE_ORIGIN_MISMATCH`, `HANDSHAKE_SOURCE_MISMATCH`, `HANDSHAKE_SESSION_MISMATCH`, `HANDSHAKE_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH`, and `HANDSHAKE_VERSION_MISMATCH` are surfaced through diagnostics when logger hooks are configured. The lifecycle outcome when no valid ready message is accepted is always `HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`. Enable debug diagnostics with `createDiagnosticRecorder` to see detailed rejection reasons during integration. See [Debugging & Diagnostics](./debugging).

## Operation Errors

Operation errors occur during active bridge communication — parent `request()`, parent or child `sendEvent()`, and parent `waitForEvent()` calls. These are delivered as rejected promises.

| Code                        | Typical cause                                                                                                               | Recovery                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPERATION_INVALID_TIMEOUT` | Per-operation `timeoutMs` is not a positive integer.                                                                        | Pass `timeoutMs` as an integer &ge; 1 in the `options` argument. Omit it to use the global `timeouts.operationTimeoutMs` default.                                             |
| `OPERATION_ABORTED`         | The `AbortSignal` passed in `options.signal` was already aborted, or was aborted while the operation was queued or pending. | This is caller-initiated cancellation, not an error condition. Create a new `AbortController` for a retry. Note: aborting a posted `sendEvent` cannot undo remote processing. |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`           | A `request()` was sent but the iframe did not respond with a matching `bridge:response` before the operation timeout.       | Check that the iframe request handler is registered and responding. Increase the timeout only if the remote work legitimately takes longer than the default 5 seconds.        |
| `REQUEST_REMOTE_ERROR`      | The iframe returned a `bridge:response` with an `error` object.                                                             | Inspect the remote error via `error.details.remoteError` — it contains `code`, `message`, and optional `data` from the iframe.                                                |
| `EVENT_WAIT_TIMEOUT`        | `waitForEvent()` did not receive a matching inbound event before the operation timeout.                                     | Register the waiter before triggering the remote action that should produce the event. Confirm the iframe sends the expected event `name`.                                    |

Child context: `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` is a parent-side error. The child SDK has no `request()` method and does not initiate `bridge:request`; child `handleRequest()` handlers only respond to parent requests.

### Accessing remote errors

When `REQUEST_REMOTE_ERROR` is thrown, the iframe's error is available in `details`:

```ts
try {
  await bridge.request('user:get', { id: '123' });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof IframeBridgeError && error.code === 'REQUEST_REMOTE_ERROR') {
    const remote = error.details as {
      remoteError: { code: string; message: string; data?: unknown };
    };
    console.error('Iframe error:', remote.remoteError.code, remote.remoteError.message);
  }
}
```

Or use the `normalizeBridgeRemoteError` helper:

```ts
import { normalizeBridgeRemoteError, IframeBridgeError } from 'iframe-helper-sdk';

try {
  await bridge.request('user:get', { id: '123' });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof IframeBridgeError && error.code === 'REQUEST_REMOTE_ERROR') {
    const remote = normalizeBridgeRemoteError(error.details);
    console.error(remote.code, remote.message);
  }
}
```

---

## Lifecycle Errors

Lifecycle errors are about the bridge's state — what it can and can't do at a given moment.

| Code                   | Typical cause                                                                                                                          | Recovery                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BRIDGE_NOT_READY`     | An operation was called before readiness and the pre-ready queue is disabled (`queue.enabled: false`).                                 | Either await `bridge.whenReady()` before communicating, or enable the queue by setting `queue.enabled: true` (the default).      |
| `BRIDGE_DESTROYED`     | An operation was attempted after `bridge.destroy()` was called, or `whenReady()` awaited a bridge that was destroyed before readiness. | `destroy()` is terminal — create a new bridge with `createIframeBridge()` or call `bridge.remount()`.                            |
| `QUEUE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Too many operations were queued before readiness, exceeding `queue.maxSize` (default: 50).                                             | Reduce pre-ready activity, increase `queue.maxSize` deliberately, or await readiness before queuing more operations.             |
| `QUEUE_CLOSED`         | An operation attempted to enter the queue, but the queue has already closed because handshake failed or the bridge was destroyed.      | Check `bridge.state` to understand why the queue closed. If the handshake failed, fix the handshake and call `bridge.remount()`. |

Child context: `BRIDGE_DESTROYED` can also reject child operations after `createIframeChildBridge()` instances are destroyed. Use `whenConnected()` as the child-side readiness gate.

:::tip Using `whenReady()` to avoid lifecycle errors

The safest pattern: `await bridge.whenReady()` before any communication. This avoids `BRIDGE_NOT_READY` entirely and lets the queue handle the window between factory creation and readiness.

```ts
const bridge = createIframeBridge({ container: '#root', src: 'https://partner.example/app' });
await bridge.whenReady();
// Now safe to communicate — bridge is ready.
const data = await bridge.request('data:get', {});
```

## Message Errors

Message errors occur at the transport/envelope level — before a message reaches application logic.

| Code                       | Typical cause                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Recovery                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `MESSAGE_INVALID_ENVELOPE` | A message matched the transport (correct origin, session, and source) but failed envelope validation — missing `type`, missing `name` on an event/request, missing `requestId` on a request/response, or an invalid `error` shape on a response. | Check that both parent and child messages follow the envelope spec: `protocol: 'iframe-bridge'`, `version: 1`, a non-empty `sessionId`, a known `type`, and required fields per type. See [Wire Protocol](./wire-protocol#envelope). |
| `MESSAGE_TARGET_MISMATCH`  | The SDK could not post a message to the iframe — the iframe window or target origin was unavailable.                                                                                                                                             | Confirm the iframe is still mounted in the DOM and `targetOrigin` is the correct exact origin. This can happen after the iframe navigates to a different origin or is removed from the DOM.                                          |

Child context: `MESSAGE_TARGET_MISMATCH` can also occur if the child cannot post to an available parent window. The child still targets the accepted exact parent origin; it should not fall back to `'*'` in normal operation.

## Error Handling Patterns

### Catch and branch by code

The `code` property lets you handle different errors differently:

```ts
import { createIframeBridge, IframeBridgeError } from 'iframe-helper-sdk';

try {
  const bridge = createIframeBridge({
    container: '#partner-frame',
    src: 'https://partner.example/app',
  });

  await bridge.whenReady();

  const user = await bridge.request('user:get', { id: '123' });
  console.log('User:', user.name);
} catch (error) {
  if (!(error instanceof IframeBridgeError)) {
    // Unexpected error — rethrow
    throw error;
  }

  switch (error.code) {
    case 'CONFIG_UNSAFE_ORIGIN':
      console.error('Origin config is invalid. Use exact HTTPS origins.', error.message);
      break;

    case 'HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT':
      console.error('Iframe did not respond. Check the iframe integration and URL.', error.message);
      // Maybe show a fallback UI
      break;

    case 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT':
      console.error('Request timed out. The iframe may be slow or unresponsive.', error.message);
      // Retry with a longer timeout, or show an error state
      break;

    case 'REQUEST_REMOTE_ERROR': {
      const remote = error.details as { remoteError: { code: string; message: string } };
      console.error(
        `Iframe returned error ${remote.remoteError.code}: ${remote.remoteError.message}`,
      );
      break;
    }

    case 'OPERATION_ABORTED':
      // Caller cancelled — do nothing
      break;

    default:
      console.error('Bridge error:', error.code, error.message, error.details);
  }
}
```

### Handling AbortSignal cancellation

The `OPERATION_ABORTED` code is used for caller-initiated cancellation via `AbortController`. It's not a true error — treat it as "the caller changed its mind."

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();

const bridge = createIframeBridge({
  container: '#root',
  src: 'https://partner.example/app',
});

await bridge.whenReady();

// Start a request that can be cancelled
const requestPromise = bridge.request(
  'search',
  { query: 'term' },
  {
    signal: controller.signal,
  },
);

// Cancel after 2 seconds if the user navigates away
setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);

try {
  const result = await requestPromise;
  console.log('Result:', result);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof IframeBridgeError && error.code === 'OPERATION_ABORTED') {
    console.log('Request was cancelled.');
    return;
  }
  throw error;
}
```

### Config validation pattern

Since config errors are synchronous, wrap only the factory call:

```ts
import { createIframeBridge, IframeBridgeError } from 'iframe-helper-sdk';

let bridge;
try {
  bridge = createIframeBridge({
    container: '#partner-frame',
    src: 'https://partner.example/app',
    securityProfile: 'strict',
    sandbox: ['allow-scripts'],
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof IframeBridgeError) {
    console.error(`Config error [${error.code}]:`, error.message);
    return;
  }
  throw error;
}

// Config validated — now await readiness
try {
  await bridge.whenReady();
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof IframeBridgeError) {
    console.error(`Bridge error [${error.code}]:`, error.message);
    return;
  }
  throw error;
}
```

## Quick Reference

All 27 error codes in one table with the most common recovery action.

| Error code                         | Category  | Recovery                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `CONFIG_INVALID_RESIZE`            | Config    | Use a valid resize axis, offsets, callback, and min/max bounds.   |
| `CONFIG_INVALID_SECURITY_PROFILE`  | Config    | Use `'strict'` or `'development'`.                                |
| `CONFIG_INVALID_TIMEOUT`           | Config    | Set timeout values to integers &ge; 1.                            |
| `CONFIG_UNSAFE_ORIGIN`             | Config    | Use exact HTTPS origins; enable `allowInsecureLocalhost` for dev. |
| `CONFIG_UNSAFE_PERMISSIONS_POLICY` | Config    | Replace wildcard `allow` with explicit feature grants.            |

| `HANDSHAKE_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH`      | Handshake | Iframe must use `protocol: 'iframe-bridge'`.                      |
| `HANDSHAKE_VERSION_MISMATCH`       | Handshake | Iframe must use `version: 1`.                                     |
| `OPERATION_INVALID_TIMEOUT`        | Operation | Pass `timeoutMs` as a positive integer.                           |

| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`                  | Operation | Check iframe request handling; increase timeout if needed.        |
| `REQUEST_REMOTE_ERROR`             | Operation | Inspect `error.details.remoteError` for the iframe's error.       |
| `EVENT_WAIT_TIMEOUT`               | Operation | Register the waiter before triggering the remote action.          |
| `BRIDGE_NOT_READY`                 | Lifecycle | Await `bridge.whenReady()` or enable the pre-ready queue.         |
| `BRIDGE_DESTROYED`                 | Lifecycle | Create a new bridge or call `bridge.remount()`.                   |
| `QUEUE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`             | Lifecycle | Reduce pre-ready activity or increase `queue.maxSize`.            |
| `QUEUE_CLOSED`                     | Lifecycle | Fix the handshake and call `bridge.remount()`.                    |
| `MESSAGE_INVALID_ENVELOPE`         | Message   | Check envelope shape against the wire protocol spec.              |
| `MESSAGE_TARGET_MISMATCH`          | Message   | Confirm the iframe is mounted and `targetOrigin` is correct.      |
